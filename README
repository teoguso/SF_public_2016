#################################################
# Before using the program, 
# one should execute the 
# bash script 'compile_and_link.sh'.
# The script 'cleanup.sh' removes all secondary 
# files created during compilation, linking and 
# testing, reverting to a clean source 
# (a.k.a. poor's man 'make distclean').
-- QUICK HOWTO --
Gather your input files (self-energy, invar.in, ...)
 -- look in the test directory for examples --
in a single directory and run 'sf.py' from there.
